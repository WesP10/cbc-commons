# Blockchain Builder Portfolio

Welcome! I’m a blockchain engineer who enjoys turning complex financial primitives into engaging, reliable products. Whether it’s architecting Solana programs, designing resilient DeFi mechanisms, or leading cross-functional teams from whiteboard to mainnet, I specialize in solving the hard problems that move web3 forward.

## Featured Projects
Each project is documented using the same structure so you can scan my approach quickly.

### BRBs Stablecoin – Cornell DeFi Sandbox
**Description:** Prototype Solana stablecoin that mirrors Cornell’s “Big Red Bucks,” enabling on-chain mint/burn and peer trading.

**Skills Used:**
- Rust (Solana Program Library) with Anchor framework modules
- Treasury management, peg maintenance, AMM economics
- TypeScript client SDK with React dApp integration

**Design/Build Process:**
1. **Ideation:** Scoped campus payment pain points & compliance requirements.
2. **Modular prototyping:** Built token, treasury, and UI modules as discrete programs.
3. **Testing & iteration:** Simulated peg pressure, added invariant checks, fuzzed redemption logic.
4. **Documentation:** Authored on-chain spec, user flows, and migration playbooks.

### USDC/BRBs Liquidity Pool
**Description:** Solana-based AMM pool that reinforces the BRBs peg and rewards liquidity providers.

**Skills Used:**
- Constant-product AMM math and LP tokenomics
- Program optimization with on-chain risk constraints
- Frontend analytics with real-time health monitors

**Design/Build Process:**
1. **Ideation:** Modeled peg resilience scenarios and LP incentives.
2. **Modular prototyping:** Deployed swap, deposit, and withdrawal instructions.
3. **Testing & iteration:** Ran stress swaps, slippage alarms, and circuit breaker drills.
4. **Documentation:** Authored integration guides for DeFi aggregators.

### Cross-Chain Derivatives Clearing Layer
**Description:** Hybrid rollup settlement layer that clears perpetual positions across L2s with time-weighted funding.

**Skills Used:**
- Solidity and Rust programs with Celestia DA integrations
- Oracle design, risk parameter governance, and batch proof verification
- Distributed systems design for cross-domain settlement

**Design/Build Process:**
1. **Ideation:** Defined clearing guarantees and latency budgets with stakeholders.
2. **Modular prototyping:** Implemented sequencer modules, proof batching, and margin vaults.
3. **Testing & iteration:** Replayed historical volatility, performed MEV resilience analysis.
4. **Documentation:** Produced validator runbooks & investor technical memos.

### Intent-Aware NFT Lending Desk
**Description:** Intent-based lending protocol that customizes NFT loan offers using off-chain searchers and on-chain intent settlement.

**Skills Used:**
- Solidity, account abstraction, and zero-knowledge attestations
- Reputation scoring with risk-adjusted pricing engines
- Off-chain orderbook infrastructure and GraphQL APIs

**Design/Build Process:**
1. **Ideation:** Researched borrower pain points and liquidity fragmentation.
2. **Modular prototyping:** Built intent router, lender strategy SDK, and settlement contracts.
3. **Testing & iteration:** Simulated oracle latency and chaos-tested keeper failures.
4. **Documentation:** Authored SDK docs & go-to-market decks.

### DAO Operations Co-Pilot
**Description:** AI-driven governance assistant that drafts proposals, forecasts quorum, and automates treasury actions.

**Skills Used:**
- TypeScript/Next.js, LangChain, and Pinecone vector search
- Governance analytics and treasury automation scripting
- UX research, growth strategy, and community management

**Design/Build Process:**
1. **Ideation:** Interviewed DAO stewards and mapped governance workflows.
2. **Modular prototyping:** Built governance parsers, simulation engines, and UI experiences.
3. **Testing & iteration:** Ran user testing, added fallback safeties, tuned LLM prompts.
4. **Documentation:** Produced onboarding guides & playbooks for delegates.
