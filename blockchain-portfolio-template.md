## Project Portfolio
Every project below follows the same template so readers can quickly compare scope, skills, and process.

### BRBs Stablecoin – Cornell DeFi Sandbox
**Description:** Prototype Solana stablecoin that mirrors Cornell’s “Big Red Bucks,” enabling on-chain mint/burn and peer trading.

**Skills Used:**
- Rust (Solana Program Library) with Anchor framework modules
- Treasury management, peg maintenance, and AMM economics
- TypeScript client SDK with React dApp integration

**Design/Build Process:**
1. **Ideation:** Scoped campus payment pain points and compliance requirements with university stakeholders.
2. **Modular prototyping:** Built token, treasury, and UI components as discrete on-chain programs.
3. **Testing & iteration:** Simulated peg pressure, added invariant checks, and fuzzed redemption logic.
4. **Documentation:** Authored on-chain spec, user flows, and migration playbooks for student operators.

### USDC/BRBs Liquidity Pool
**Description:** Solana-based AMM pool that reinforces the BRBs peg and rewards liquidity providers.

**Skills Used:**
- Constant-product AMM math, LP tokenomics, and circuit breaker design
- Program optimization with on-chain risk constraints and monitoring hooks
- Frontend analytics with real-time pool health dashboards

**Design/Build Process:**
1. **Ideation:** Modeled peg resilience scenarios and liquidity incentives to balance slippage and depth.
2. **Modular prototyping:** Deployed swap, deposit, and withdrawal instructions with deterministic pricing.
3. **Testing & iteration:** Ran stress swaps, configured slippage alarms, and rehearsed circuit breaker drills.
4. **Documentation:** Authored integration guides for DeFi aggregators and campus merchants.

### Cross-Chain Derivatives Clearing Layer
**Description:** Hybrid rollup settlement layer that clears perpetual positions across L2s with time-weighted funding.

**Skills Used:**
- Solidity and Rust programs connected to Celestia DA for data availability
- Oracle design, risk parameter governance, and batch proof verification
- Distributed systems architecture for multi-domain settlement

**Design/Build Process:**
1. **Ideation:** Defined clearing guarantees, latency budgets, and failure domains with exchange partners.
2. **Modular prototyping:** Implemented sequencer modules, proof batching, and margin vault contracts.
3. **Testing & iteration:** Replayed historical volatility, analyzed MEV resilience, and tuned funding intervals.
4. **Documentation:** Produced validator runbooks, protocol whitepapers, and investor technical memos.

### Intent-Aware NFT Lending Desk
**Description:** Intent-based lending protocol that customizes NFT loan offers using off-chain searchers and on-chain settlement.

**Skills Used:**
- Solidity, account abstraction flows, and zero-knowledge attestations
- Reputation scoring, risk-adjusted pricing, and keeper coordination
- Off-chain orderbook infrastructure with GraphQL APIs and analytics

**Design/Build Process:**
1. **Ideation:** Researched borrower pain points, liquidity fragmentation, and market-making incentives.
2. **Modular prototyping:** Built intent router, lender strategy SDK, and settlement contracts with guardrails.
3. **Testing & iteration:** Simulated oracle latency, chaos-tested keeper failures, and load-tested API throughput.
4. **Documentation:** Authored SDK docs, lending strategy playbooks, and go-to-market collateral.
